#### Multi-tenant Architecture
Software architecture where a single instance of the application serves multiple customers (tenants) with data isolation.

#### API Gateway
Server that acts as an intermediary between clients and backend services, handling authentication, rate limiting, and monitoring.

#### REST APIs
Architectural style for designing networked applications using HTTP methods.

#### GraphQL
Query language and runtime for APIs that allows clients to request exactly the data they need.

#### WebSocket
Communication protocol that provides full-duplex communication channels over a single TCP connection.

#### NextAuth.js
Authentication library for Next.js applications.

#### Prisma ORM
Tool that maps database records to objects in application code.

#### PostgreSQL
Open-source relational database management system.

#### Redis Cache
In-memory data structure store used as a database, cache, and message broker.

#### Message Queue (RabbitMQ)
Message broker that enables applications to communicate by sending messages to each other.
